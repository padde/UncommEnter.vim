UncommEnter
===========

UncommEnter lets you end a comment series caused by formatoption "r" by
simply hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> on the last empty line of a comment.

For more information on usage, options and license, see UncommEnter.txt
or type `:help UncommEnter` inside Vim.

Installation
------------

*Pathogen*

```sh
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/padde/UncommEnter.vim.git
```

*Vundle*

add this line to your `~/.vimrc`:

```viml
Bundle 'padde/UncommEnter.vim'
```



Examples (Ruby)
---------------

In the following examples, `|` represents the cursor.

```ruby
# this is a comment|
```

hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>

```ruby
# this is a comment
# |
```

hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> again

```ruby
# this is a comment
|
```

This means you don't have to type <kbd>Esc</kbd>+<kbd>â‡§</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>
or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>u</kbd> any more. UncommEnter is smart enough to not
fiddle around with comments when you're in the middle of a multi-line comment
like this one:

```ruby
# this is a comment|
# that spans multiple lines
```

hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>

```ruby
# this is a comment
# |
# that spans multiple lines
```

hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> again

```ruby
# this is a comment
#
# |
# that spans multiple lines
```

The tradeoff is that if you actually want multiple empty comment lines,
you have to re-add one line manually:

```ruby
# this is a comment|
```

hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>

```ruby
# this is a comment
# |
```

hit <kbd>Esc</kbd>o

```ruby
# this is a comment
#
# |
```

UncommEnter will however not delete the comment marker if the previous
line is also just an empty comment. That means for successive empty
comment lines, you can just hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> as normal:

```ruby
# this is a comment
#
# |
```

hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> twice

```ruby
# this is a comment
#
#
#
# |
```
